Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students.

This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.

All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes.  This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities, City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. 1.	Methods and Caveat â€“ The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a â€œbathtubâ€ù methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils, vegetation, surface permeability, bathymetry, infrastructure and beach structures, friction, and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent.2.	Error â€“ Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models), error inherent in model output, errors in and coarseness of topography, the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot, and in GIS technique.3.	Interpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environmental-Sustainability/Flood-Plain-Scenario-Rapid-Ice-Melt-2020-2050-2080/qfva-z2r5,0,Environmental Sustainability,"flood, flood plain, rapid ice melt, 2020, 2050, 2080",0,qfva-z2r5External,Alternate Side Parking (Transportation/Alternate-Side-Parking/x6gf-qdui),"RSS Feed displaying alternate side parking updatesUpdated daily",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Alternate-Side-Parking/x6gf-qdui,0,Transportation,,0,x6gf-qduiMap,Neighborhood Names GIS (Other/Neighborhood-Names-GIS/99bc-9p23),GIS data: neighborhood labels as depicted in New York City: A City of Neighborhoods,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Other/Neighborhood-Names-GIS/99bc-9p23,0,Other,"geographic, location, map, cartography, neighborhood, historic, scenic, interest, area of interest, areas of interest, dcp, city planning, neighborhood names, gis",0,99bc-9p23Map,Manhattan Parks (Facilities-and-Structures/Manhattan-Parks/pgjy-zpbp),GIS Map of New York City Department of Parks & Recreation parks.,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Facilities-and-Structures/Manhattan-Parks/pgjy-zpbp,0,Facilities and Structures,"park, parks, nature, recreation, location, map, cartography, geographic",0,pgjy-zpbpMap,2010 Census Tracts (Government/2010-Census-Tracts/uihr-eiyq),GIS Data: 2010 Census Tracts,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Government/2010-Census-Tracts/uihr-eiyq,0,Government,"census, geographic, location, map, cartography, boundary, block, survey, poll, 20010 census blocks & tracts gis: 2010 census tracts, dcp",0,uihr-eiyqMap,Map of Monuments (Facilities-and-Structures/Map-of-Monuments/hdr6-7r95),GIS Map of Permanent Art and Monuments in New York City Department of Parks & Recreation properties.,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Facilities-and-Structures/Map-of-Monuments/hdr6-7r95,0,Facilities and Structures,"map, location, cartography, site, art, public, permanent, culture, history, historical, monument, sculpture, statue",1,hdr6-7r95Tabular,AP (College Board) 2010 School Level Results (Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e),"New York City school level College Board AP results for 2010.  Records with 5 or fewer students are suppressed. Students are linked to schools by identifying which school they attend when registering for a College Board exam.

The NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (NYC OLTPS) and the City of New York assume no responsibility for the accuracy of this data or its suitability for any purposes. All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes. This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities, City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. 1.	Methods and Caveat â€“ The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a â€œbathtubâ€ù methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils, vegetation, surface permeability, bathymetry, infrastructure and beach structures, friction, and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent. 2.	Error â€“ Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models), error inherent in model output, errors in and coarseness of topography, the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot, and in GIS technique. 3.	Interpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environmental-Sustainability/Flood-Plain-Scenario-Central-Range-Sea-Level-Rise-/mu44-3ky4,0,Environmental Sustainability,"flood, flood plain, central range sea level",0,mu44-3ky4Tabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to Deputy Commissioners and Miscellaneous Commands 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Deputy-Commissio/6m56-5mfb),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Deputy-Commissio/6m56-5mfb,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,6m56-5mfbBlob,Property Valuation and Assessment Data (Property/Property-Valuation-and-Assessment-Data/rgy2-tti8),Property valuation and assessment data (Condensed Assessed Value Roll),https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Property/Property-Valuation-and-Assessment-Data/rgy2-tti8,0,Property,"finance, property, tax, value, valuation, assess, assessment, condense, condensed, roll",0,rgy2-tti8Tabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to Other Bureaus 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Other-Bureaus-20/bexe-qnej),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Frequency: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Other-Bureaus-20/bexe-qnej,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,bexe-qnejFilter,NYC OpenData Catalog (Other/NYC-OpenData-Catalog/v7cz-dmwq),This is the current list of all the datasets available on NYC Open Data,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Other/NYC-OpenData-Catalog/v7cz-dmwq,0,Other,"data sets, list, data, opendata, catalog, nyc opendata catalog",0,v7cz-dmwqMap,"landmarks, manhattan, individual (Cultural-Affairs/landmarks-manhattan-individual/crwx-795d)","Landmarks Preservation Commission point shapefile.

This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.The TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). Existing TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  Possible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   TC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.The TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environmental-Sustainability/NYC-Urban-Tree-Canopy-Assessment-Metrics-2010/hnxz-kkn5,0,Environmental Sustainability,"landcover, tree, canopy, grass, water, buildings, roads, paved",0,hnxz-kkn5Tabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to Patrol Boroughs and Other Commands 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Patrol-Boroughs-/egiq-kmr5),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Schedule: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Patrol-Boroughs-/egiq-kmr5,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,egiq-kmr5Tabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to Special Operations Division 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Special-Operatio/rfu3-4gsz),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Schedule: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Special-Operatio/rfu3-4gsz,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,rfu3-4gszTabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to the Detective Bureau 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-the-Detective-Bu/fgb7-3q7d),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Schedule: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-the-Detective-Bu/fgb7-3q7d,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,fgb7-3q7dTabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to the Housing Bureau 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-the-Housing-Bure/cqhy-d5cj),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Schedule: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-the-Housing-Bure/cqhy-d5cj,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,cqhy-d5cjTabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to the Organized Crime Control Bureau 2005 â€“ 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-the-Organized-Cr/v3a6-muuw),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Schedule: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-the-Organized-Cr/v3a6-muuw,0,Public Safety,"complaint, civilian, review, board, activity, ccrb, civilian complaint review board, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, complaint activity, statistics",0,v3a6-muuwFilter,electronic store competitors (Business-and-Economic/electronic-store-competitors/r9jk-nd53),A list of electronics stores that have a current DCA license as of the run date.,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business-and-Economic/electronic-store-competitors/r9jk-nd53,0,Business and Economic,"retail, sale, sell, license, store, electronics, consumer affairs, dca",0,r9jk-nd53Map,Theaters (Other/Theaters/kdu2-865w),Listing of NYC theaters,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Other/Theaters/kdu2-865w,0,Other,"theater, entertainment, screen, show, play, cinema, movie, doitt gis",0,kdu2-865wTabular,CCRB: Attribution of Complaints to Traffic Control Division 2005 - 2009 (Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Traffic-Control-/35fd-ehz6),"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) complaint activity data, 2005-2009.Update Frequency: Annually",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/CCRB-Attribution-of-Complaints-to-Traffic-Control-/35fd-ehz6,0,Public Safety,"complaint activity, statistics",0,35fd-ehz6Map,Zoning GIS Data: ESRI Geo-database (Government/Zoning-GIS-Data-ESRI-Geo-database/gq8z-zwkq),"GIS data: This data set consists of 6 classes of zoning features: zoning districts, special purpose districts, special purpose district subdistricts, limited height districts, commercial overlay districts,  and zoning map amendments.",https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Government/Zoning-GIS-Data-ESRI-Geo-database/gq8z-zwkq,0,Government,"zoning, geographic, location, map, cartography, zone, district, commercial, dcp",0,gq8z-zwkqMap,Google map view of 311 reports (Other/Google-map-view-of-311-reports/dtiu-hq3j),All 311 Service Request from 2010 to Present.

In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts.

We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.

Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.
